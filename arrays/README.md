This problem was relatively simple to solve, knowing the mathematical relationship between the number of subarrays in a given N length array. I iterated once over the array, calculating the length of each run of zeroes until a nonzero number was encountered. Then it was as simple as accumulating the number of subarrays within the zero run array into a variable. Determining how many subarrays are within that zero array is simple to understand through inspection when you consider that there will be N singleton subarrays containing 1 zero, and only 1 subarray containing N zeroes. then it can be seen that there will be N-1 subarrays of length 2, N-2 subarrays of length 3, and so on. This is most easily visualized by imagining a sliding window of various sizes. Outside of the loop all that needed to be done was to accumulate the rest of the subarrays if the initial array ended in a zero and to return the value.

After looking at some discussion posts, it seems there was an even faster way of determining that quantity of subarrays. Whereas I summed all of the natural numbers from 1 to N, where N was the run length, that sum can be imagined as a triangle and its area can be found with the formula $n(n+1)/2$.
